# Dune Awakening Dashboard

A comprehensive web-based management dashboard for Dune: Awakening private servers. Provides real-time monitoring, player management, chat logging, file browsing, and server administration tools.

> <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">⚠ Early Development</span> — This is an early version being developed in real time. Features may be incomplete, unstable, or broken. Use at your own risk. Report issues on GitHub.
>
> **Branch Status**: The `main` branch is currently **beta** — there is no stable release yet. The `nightly` branch is the bleeding-edge development branch.

## Quick Start

### Windows
1. Double-click `setup.bat`
2. Follow the prompts
3. Double-click `start.bat` to launch

> **Tip**: Ensure your SSH key is in `internal-scripts/ssh/sshKey` before running setup.

## Features

- **Real-time Overview**: Server metrics, player counts, pod status, and resource usage.
- **Player Management**: View, search, and filter players. Track online status, factions, guilds, and locations.
- **Chat Logs**: Parsed from text-router pod logs with channel filtering and auto-refresh.
- **Director Controls**: Live battlegroup stats, world state management, and server transfer controls.
- **File Browser**: Secure SSH-based file browser for server configuration and logs.
- **Shell Access**: Interactive VM and Kubernetes pod shells directly in the browser.
- **Admin Tools**: Ban management, IP detection, kick/unban functionality, and player history.
- **Firewall Security**: Block unauthenticated game server ports (File Browser, Director, PostgreSQL) from external internet access. Applied via iptables on the game server VM across INPUT, FORWARD, and mangle PREROUTING chains to cover both host services and Kubernetes NodePort traffic. Configurable per-port during setup or from the Server page.
- **Vehicles & Buildings**: Track owned vehicles, modules, and player structures.
- **Auto-Update**: Background checker polls GitHub for new commits. Safe file replacement preserves your settings, logs, and SSH keys. One-click update from the dashboard.
- **Remote Access**: Built-in support for HTTPS and binding to `0.0.0.0` for secure remote management.
- **Let's Encrypt**: Optionally set up publicly trusted SSL certs during setup with automatic renewal via certbot.
- **Firewall Security**: Block unauthenticated game server ports (File Browser, Director, PostgreSQL) from external internet access. Applied via iptables on the game server VM. Configurable per-port during setup or from the Server page.
- **Settings Migration**: Automatically adds new configuration options to `settings.yaml` when updating, so you never miss a feature.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows (`.bat`/`.ps1`) and Linux/macOS (`.sh`).

## License

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenSSH client
- `kubectl` access to the Dune: Awakening Kubernetes cluster
- SSH access to the game server VM

## Setup

### Windows

1. **Run Setup**
   ```powershell
   .\setup.ps1
   ```
   This will install dependencies, configure your SSH key, and generate `settings.yaml`.

   During setup you'll be prompted for:
   - **VM External IP** — the IP you SSH into (e.g., `65.21.198.100`)
   - **Host External IP** — the public IP for SSL certificate SANs (e.g., `65.21.198.107`)
   - **Let's Encrypt** — optionally set up a publicly trusted SSL cert with auto-renewal via certbot
   - **Firewall rules** — only prompted if no `DuneDashboard` rule exists yet

2. **Start Dashboard**
   ```powershell
   .\start.ps1
   ```
   This starts the SSH tunnel, database port-forward, and launches the dashboard.

### Linux / macOS

1. **Run Setup**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh start.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Start Dashboard**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

## Configuration

All settings are stored in `settings.yaml`. The setup script generates this automatically. Key settings include:

- `server.host`: Game server VM IP
- `server.ssh_key`: Path to your SSH private key
- `kubernetes.namespace`: Auto-detected K8s namespace
- `database.port`: Local port for database tunnel
- `auth.username` / `auth.password`: Dashboard login credentials

### Remote Access

During setup, answer **y** to "Enable remote access?" to:
- Bind to `0.0.0.0` (accessible from other machines)
- Auto-generate SSL certificates for HTTPS
- Enable secure remote connections via `https://YOUR_IP:5050`

**Firewall rules** are created automatically during setup. On subsequent starts, `start.ps1`/`start.sh` will only prompt if the `DuneDashboard` rule is missing.

You can also manually edit `settings.yaml` later:
```yaml
dashboard:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  ssl_cert: ssl/cert.pem
  ssl_key: ssl/key.pem
```

### Let's Encrypt (Publicly Trusted Certs)

During setup, answer **y** when asked to enable Let's Encrypt. The setup script will:
1. Install `certbot` (tries `winget`, `pip`, and `python -m` fallbacks on Windows)
2. Run `certbot certonly --standalone` to validate your domain
3. Configure auto-renewal via Windows Scheduled Task or Linux cron
4. Point the dashboard to the Let's Encrypt cert paths

> **Note**: Port 80 must be free during certbot validation. The dashboard's HTTP redirect server will release port 80 temporarily for this.

### Local CA Utilities (Windows)

Two helper scripts are included for managing the self-signed CA:
- **`install-ca-cert.bat`** — Installs the local CA (`ssl/ca.pem`) into Windows Trusted Root store. Run as Administrator. Removes browser warnings.
- **`clean-ca-certs.bat`** — Removes the dashboard CA from Windows Trusted Root store. Run as Administrator.

### SSL Configuration

The dashboard supports both self-signed and CA-signed certificates.

**Local CA (auto-generated during setup):**
- A local Certificate Authority (`ssl/ca.pem`) is created during setup
- Server certificates are signed by this CA
- Server certs include SAN for the server IP + `127.0.0.1` + `localhost`
- Valid for 365 days

**Remove browser warnings (Windows):**
1. Run `install-ca-cert.bat` as Administrator
2. Restart your browser
3. Access `https://localhost:5050` — no more warnings

**Remove browser warnings (Linux):**
```bash
sudo cp ssl/ca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/dune-dashboard-ca.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

**Let's Encrypt or custom CA:**
```yaml
dashboard:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  ssl_cert: /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem
  ssl_key: /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem
```

When SSL is enabled:
- Session cookies are marked `Secure` (sent only over HTTPS)
- HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect runs on port+1 (e.g., `http://localhost:5051` → `https://localhost:5050`)
- Certificate expiry is checked at startup (warning if < 30 days)

**Regenerate certificates:**
Delete `ssl/cert.pem`, `ssl/key.pem`, and `ssl/ca*.pem`, then re-run setup.

### Auto-Renewal

SSL certificates are automatically regenerated when they approach expiry:
- A background thread checks the certificate every 24 hours (configurable)
- If the certificate expires within 30 days (configurable), a new one is generated
- The server does **not** need to restart — Flask-SocketIO picks up the new cert on the next connection
- Configure thresholds in `settings.yaml` under the `ssl:` section

## Security Notes

- Never commit `settings.yaml` to version control.
- SSH keys are copied to `%TEMP%` with restricted permissions during startup.
- All database queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection.
- Dashboard authentication is required by default.
